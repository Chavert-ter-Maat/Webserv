Choose the port and host of each ’server’. 												ServerStruct listen; 

• Setup the server_names or not.														ServerStruct server_name; 

• The first server for a host:port will be the default for this host:port (that means
it will answer to all the requests that don’t belong to an other server).				something about setting the default to one server

• Setup default error pages.															Error code, nginx example="error_page 404 /error/404.html;" not implemented yet

• Limit client body size.																Chunk limit not implemented yet

• Setup routes with one or multiple of the following rules/configuration (routes wont
be using regexp):

	◦ Define a list of accepted HTTP methods for the route.								Allowed Methods do be implemented

	◦ Define a HTTP redirection.														Return to specific page instead of trying to handle, to be implemented

	◦ Define a directory or a file from where the file should be searched (for example,	Root is set up.
	if url /kapouet is rooted to /tmp/www, url /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet is
	/tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet).

	◦ Turn on or off directory listing.													autoindex on/off;

	◦ Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory.						index index.html

	◦ Execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php).					Is available partly working

	◦ Make it work with POST and GET methods.											Is available partly working

	◦ Make the route able to accept uploaded files and configure where they should
	be saved.
		∗ Do you wonder what a CGI is?
		∗ Because you won’t call the CGI directly, use the full path as PATH_INFO.
		∗ Just remember that, for chunked request, your server needs to unchunk
		it, the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body.
		∗ Same things for the output of the CGI. If no content_length is returned
		from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.
		∗ Your program should call the CGI with the file requested as first argument.
		∗ The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.
		∗ Your server should work with one CGI (php-CGI, Python,
